This is the first o Brazilian Multilabel Ophthalmological Dataset with demographic information and retinal photos labeled images according to anatomical parameters, quality control, and presumed diagnosis.
The BRSET has a total of 16,266  images from 8,524 patients evaluated from 2010 to 2020, and includes macula cenetered JPEG retinal fundus photos from a Nikon NF505 and a Canon CR2 camera.

Associated with the retina labeling are the camera device, patients' nationality, age in years, sex, clinical antecedents, insulin use, and diabetes time.


### Our objective is to reduce the under-represented countries in the ophthalmology dataset pool used for the development of models.
